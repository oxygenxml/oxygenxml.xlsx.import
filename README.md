# Excel XLSX Libraries v3.10 Add-on
By Default, Oxygen XML Editor does not come bundled with libraries that would enable you to import XML content from newer versions of Excel. This add-on contributes the libraries necessary to provide this support.

## Compatibility

This add-on is compatible with versions 17.0 through 22.1 of Oxygen XML Editor/Author/Developer. 

For Oxygen XML Editor/Author/Developer versions 23 and 23.1, use the following add-on instead: https://github.com/oxygenxml/oxygenxml.xlsx.import-poi.3.17.

Starting with version 24, Oxygen comes bundled with these libraries.

## Installation

1. Go to **Help->Install new add-ons** to open an add-on selection dialog box.
2. Enter or paste https://www.oxygenxml.com/InstData/Addons/default/updateSite.xml in the **Show add-ons from** field or select it from the drop-down menu.
3. Select **Excel XLSX libraries** add-on and click **Next**.
4. Read the end-user license agreement. Then select the **I accept all terms of the end-user license agreement** option and click **Finish**.
5. Restart the application.

Result: You can now use the Import wizard to import data from Excel 2007 or newer.
