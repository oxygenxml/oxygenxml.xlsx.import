# Excel XLSX Libraries Add-on
By Default, Oxygen XML Editor does not come bundled with libraries that would enable you to import XML content from newer versions of Excel. This add-on contributes the libraries necessary to provide this support.

## Installation

1. Go to **Help->Install new add-ons** to open an add-on selection dialog box.
2. Enter or paste http://www.oxygenxml.com/InstData/Addons/default/updateSite.xml in the **Show add-ons from** field or select it from the drop-down menu.
3. Select **Excel XLSX libraries** add-on and click **Next**.
4. Select the **I accept all terms of the end user license agreement** option and click **Finish**.
5. Restart the application.

Result: You can now use the Import wizard to import data from Excel 2007 or newer.
